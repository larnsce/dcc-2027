# AI disclosure

This statement records how AI was used to produce the files in this repository. It follows the method the Global Health Engineering group at ETH Zurich uses for its outputs: every commit names its author type in a trailer, and the prompts behind AI assisted changes are archived in the repository. The same method is the subject of the "Disclosure" question in the submitted abstract and will be shown in the workshop.

## Summary

An AI coding agent drafted the workshop abstract from two documents I wrote myself, a spoken draft and a prompt with instructions. I chose between the drafts, added review notes, applied one wording change from a reviewer, and decided the final text. The agent ran the word counts, checked one factual claim on the web, rendered the submission documents, and drafted this statement.

## Tools

- Claude Code by Anthropic, running the model Claude Fable 5.1 (model id claude-fable-5-1), on 20 and 21 October 2026.
- Quarto 1.10 to render the docx. No AI is involved in rendering.

## What the agent did

- Read context from my personal knowledge base: the group's data publishing workflow, the washr and pkgreview tools, and my notes on publisher AI curation services and on AI disclosure.
- Read two public web pages on 20 October 2026: the Frontiers page on FAIR² data management, to check the price and the AI data steward named in the abstract, and the RDM Network page of the University of Basel, to understand the audience.
- Wrote two abstract versions from spoken-draft.md and initial-prompt.md, one in plain language and one in conventional academic language, each within the 350 word limit.
- Combined the two into the final version after I asked for the shape of the first and the terminology of the second, and worked my five review notes into it.
- Applied one wording change from a reviewer.
- Rendered the docx, wrote session-plan.md, updated README.md, drafted the submission email and drafted this statement.

## What I did

- Wrote spoken-draft.md and initial-prompt.md without AI and committed them myself.
- Decided to combine the two versions, wrote the review notes in drafts/2026-10-20-abstract-versions-a-b.md, and named the audience.
- Read and approved every version of the abstract. The final text is my responsibility.
- Chose which prompts to archive. The archive is selective: it holds the prompts I selected at each commit, not every message.

## How to verify

- Every commit the agent touched carries an `Assisted-by:` trailer. Every commit I touched carries a `Human-authored: true` trailer. A commit with both trailers is mixed.
- The commit "initial drafts" carries no trailer because I made it outside the commit tool. Its two files are mine.
- The `prompts/` folder holds the archived prompts, one file each, with the model and the files touched. The `Prompts:` trailer of a commit lists the archive ids of that commit.

```
git log --grep='^Assisted-by:'      # commits with AI assistance
git log --grep='^Human-authored:'   # commits with human authored changes
git log --all --grep='<prompt id>'  # the commit behind an archived prompt
```

This statement was drafted by the agent and reviewed by me.
